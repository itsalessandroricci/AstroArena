## Description

Welcome to **AstroArena**, an educational game born from my greatest passion for space. Crafted through coding, AstroArena aims to share my enthusiasm for space exploration and rekindle others' appreciation for the beauty and wonder of the cosmos. The game starts with a stunning starry background, a photo captured last summer with my iPhone during a long exposure experiment in an Italian mountain valley. Once you click start, you'll find yourself on a screen with all the chapters, each dedicated to a component of our solar system, from the Sun to Neptune in order of proximity to the sun. Clicking on a chapter reveals a lifelike 3D representation of the planet, crafted by me using Blender and brought to life with SceneKit. Players can interact with the planets, accompanied by brief yet informative descriptions. Every third chapter is followed by a quiz to test players' knowledge. Completing a chapter rewards players with a celebratory message, while unfinished games encourage players to try again and succeed. This is my game, and I hope players find joy in exploring the cosmos through AstroArena!

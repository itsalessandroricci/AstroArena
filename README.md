# AstroArena
Swift Student Challenge 2024

AstroArena is an educational game, born from my greatest passion for space. Through coding, I crafted this game to share my enthusiasm and rekindle others' appreciation for the beauty and wonder of space. The game begins with a stunning starry background, a photo I captured last summer with my iPhone during a long exposure experiment in an Italian mountain valley. After you click start, you will find yourself in a screen with all the chapters, each one dedicated to a component of our solar system, from the Sun to Neptune in order of proximity to the sun. Clicking on a chapter reveals a lifelike 3D representation of the planet, crafted by me using Blender and brought to life with SceneKit. Players can interact with the planets, accompanied by brief yet informative descriptions. Every third chapter is followed by a quiz, to test players' knowledge. Completing a chapter rewards players with a celebratory message, while unfinished games encourage players to try again and succeed. This is my game, and I hope players find joy in exploring the cosmos through AstroArena!
